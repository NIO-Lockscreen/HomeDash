# Home Organizer

A Vercel-hosted always-on home organizer with a Surface Pro display mode and a phone admin mode.

## What changed in this version

- Google Calendar sync has been removed for now.
- Events/tasks are saved to Vercel Blob only.
- Repeating tasks are stored as **one master task** with a repeat rule. The app no longer needs to create many copied tasks for weekly/biweekly/yearly repeats.
- If the server is busy/offline, phone/admin changes are saved locally on the phone first and retried automatically.
- Pending saves are kept in `localStorage` until Vercel accepts them.

## Required Vercel setup

Create/connect a Vercel Blob store, then add this environment variable:

```txt
ADMIN_PIN=your_pin_here
```

Vercel Blob should provide `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` automatically when the store is connected to the project.

Redeploy after changing environment variables.

## URLs

Display mode for the Surface Pro:

```txt
https://your-project.vercel.app/?display=1
```

Phone admin mode:

```txt
https://your-project.vercel.app/?admin=1
```

## Offline / busy-server safety

When you create, edit, complete, or delete a task from the phone, the app first stores the change on the phone in a pending queue. It then sends the change to Vercel. If Vercel is busy or the network fails, the task stays in the local queue and the app retries automatically every 15 seconds and whenever the phone comes back online.

Open the hidden config menu by holding anywhere on the dashboard/admin screen. It shows the number of pending saves and has a retry button.

## Repeating tasks

Repeating tasks use these fields on the single master event:

```json
{
  "repeat": "weekly",
  "completedDates": ["2026-05-10"],
  "excludedDates": ["2026-05-17"]
}
```

The browser expands those into temporary occurrences for display only. The server keeps just the master task.
